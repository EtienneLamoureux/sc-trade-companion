# Contributing
Thank you for your interest in the project!

## What to work on
If you are new to the project, take a look at issues tagged with ["Good first issue" or "Help wanted"](https://github.com/EtienneLamoureux/sc-trade-companion/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3A%22good%20first%20issue%22%20label%3A%22help%20wanted%22): these would be the best issues to work on as a new contributor. That being said, [any issue in our backlog](https://github.com/EtienneLamoureux/sc-trade-companion/issues) is up for grabs, so feel free to pitch in on anything that catches your eye!

Please note that unsolicited contributions (features not in our backlog) may take a lot longer to get reviewed and merged, and may get rejected entirely.

## Guidelines
To ensure quality and consistency, we ask that contrbutions follow these guidelines: 
1. Your branch MUST compile through our [Java CI with Gradle](https://github.com/EtienneLamoureux/sc-trade-companion/actions/workflows/gradle.yml)
2. Code MUST be formatted according to our [code style](https://github.com/EtienneLamoureux/sc-trade-companion/blob/main/contributing/GoogleStyle.xml) and defined [import order](https://github.com/EtienneLamoureux/sc-trade-companion/blob/main/contributing/companion.importorder)
3. Files in `tools.sctrade.companion.domain` MUST NOT import files from outside the package, with the exception of `tools.sctrade.companion.utils`
4. Public classes and methods MUST be documented
5. Changes MUST be unit tested
6. Changes MUST NOT reduce the existing code coverage
7. Changes SHOULD respect the general structure of the project
8. Changes SHOULD be self-explanatory, using clear names and flow
9. Libraries SHOULD be abstracted behind a [facade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facade_pattern)
10. Changes SHOULD NOT introduce new compiler warnings
11. Changes SHOULD NOT introduce new [CheckStyle](https://github.com/EtienneLamoureux/sc-trade-companion/blob/main/contributing/google_style.xml) warnings

## Testing

## Submitting your contribution
The project builds locally and your changes do what they are supposed to? Great! 
Running `gradlew spotlessApply` will format the code and organize the imports correctly.
