## F.A.Q.
### Why would I use this?
It auto-scrapes commodity kiosk terminals at the press of a button, and gives you all that data in CSV format! It also helps the Star Citizen community at large by contributing to a shared pool of information.

### Where are my screenshot processed?
Locally, on your computer. 

### Is any data transmitted to a third-party?
We take your privacy very seriously. The only data sent out are the final, parsed commodity listings. They are published to [SC Trade Tools](https://sc-trade.tools).
